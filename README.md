# FindMyPet
Application to help people be reunited with their lost pets
ASP.NET MVC, code first

Originally created Database first using a mocked database file in SQL Management Studio.
Unfortunately, I was not able to get far with that version, however, mapping out my data helped me figure out what information I needed to map to views. I did not keep or push this version.

TODO:
Use OWIN to handle user accounts and authentication
Add Xamarin.Forms project to make it cross platform

I have greater ambitions for the project, but will not share it publically until I have some sort of prototype up and running
